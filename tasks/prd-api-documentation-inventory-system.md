# Product Requirements Document: API Documentation and Inventory System

## Introduction/Overview

The API Documentation and Inventory System is a comprehensive analysis and documentation tool designed to create structured inventories of all APIs across our microservices architecture (from automate-trunk to tcct-serviceabstraction-dev). This system addresses the current lack of visibility into existing APIs, service dependencies, and external integrations across all of our services .

The primary goal is to provide a centralized, searchable, and comprehensive view of our entire API ecosystem to improve developer productivity, reduce integration time, enhance incident response capabilities, and ensure compliance with documentation standards.

## Goals

1. **Complete API Visibility**: Document 100% of API endpoints across ALL services with comprehensive detail
2. **Exhaustive Service Coverage**: Ensure no service is missed - from automate-trunk to tcct-serviceabstraction-dev and everything in between
3. **Detailed API Analysis**: Capture complete endpoint specifications, including all parameters, headers, authentication, and data schemas
4. **Dependency Mapping**: Create a complete map of internal service dependencies and external API integrations
5. **Multiple Output Formats**: Generate documentation in Markdown, OpenAPI specifications, and interactive dashboard formats
6. **Developer Productivity**: Reduce API discovery and integration time by 60%
7. **Incident Response**: Improve mean time to resolution by providing clear dependency maps
8. **Compliance**: Establish comprehensive API documentation standards across all services

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want to quickly find all available APIs in a service so that I can integrate with it without having to read through the entire codebase.

2. **As a DevOps engineer**, I want to understand service dependencies so that I can plan deployments and troubleshoot issues more effectively.

3. **As a product manager**, I want to see what APIs are available across services so that I can plan feature development and avoid duplicate functionality.

4. **As a security engineer**, I want to audit all external API calls made by our services so that I can assess security risks and compliance requirements.

5. **As a new team member**, I want to understand the API landscape quickly so that I can contribute to projects without extensive onboarding time.

6. **As an architect**, I want to identify API patterns and inconsistencies across services so that I can improve our overall system design.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Complete Service Discovery**: The system must automatically identify and process ALL services from automate-trunk to tcct-serviceabstraction-dev, ensuring no service is overlooked, processing one service at a time to manage context.

2. **Comprehensive API Endpoint Detection**: The system must scan codebases and identify ALL API endpoints with complete detail including:
   - HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD, etc.)
   - URL paths and route patterns (including dynamic routes and wildcards)
   - Query parameters and path variables (with types and constraints)
   - Request/response content types and formats
   - HTTP headers (required and optional)
   - Authentication and authorization requirements

3. **Complete Schema Extraction**: The system must extract and document ALL request/response formats with full detail including:
   - Complete JSON schemas with nested object definitions
   - Required vs optional fields with detailed descriptions
   - Data types, validation rules, and constraints (min/max values, regex patterns, etc.)
   - Example payloads for all scenarios (success, error, edge cases)
   - Content-Type variations and format specifications

4. **Comprehensive External Dependency Tracking**: The system must identify and catalog ALL external dependencies:
   - External service domain names and complete endpoint URLs
   - Full external API endpoint URLs with HTTP methods and parameters
   - Third-party integrations with detailed purposes and data flow
   - API keys, authentication methods, and rate limits for external services
   - Frequency and criticality of external API usage

5. **Complete Internal Dependency Mapping**: The system must map ALL internal service-to-service API calls and dependencies with full detail:
   - Direct service-to-service API calls with endpoints and methods
   - Indirect dependencies through shared resources or databases
   - Data flow patterns and communication protocols
   - Service dependency hierarchy and criticality levels

6. **Multi-Format Output Generation**: The system must generate documentation in three formats:
   - Markdown files stored in each service repository
   - OpenAPI/Swagger specifications for each service
   - Data for an interactive API explorer dashboard

7. **Structured Data Export**: The system must export inventory data in JSON/YAML format for programmatic access.

8. **Complete Service Metadata Collection**: The system must collect and document ALL service details:
   - Service name, description, and business purpose
   - Complete technology stack and framework versions used
   - Authentication/authorization mechanisms with detailed specifications
   - Rate limiting and throttling policies with exact limits
   - Service ownership, contact information, and documentation links
   - Deployment patterns and environment configurations
   - Health check endpoints and monitoring capabilities

9. **Comprehensive Error Handling Documentation**: The system must document ALL error scenarios:
   - Complete list of HTTP status codes returned by each endpoint
   - Detailed error response formats and message structures
   - Error handling patterns and retry mechanisms
   - Validation errors with field-specific messages
   - Business logic errors and exception handling

10. **Thorough Context Management**: The system must process services individually to maintain manageable context windows while ensuring NO detail is missed in the analysis.

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Real-time Updates**: This is not a real-time monitoring system - it's a point-in-time analysis tool
2. **Automated Continuous Updates**: No CI/CD integration or automated updates on code changes
3. **API Testing**: The system will not test API functionality or validate responses
4. **Performance Monitoring**: No performance metrics or monitoring capabilities
5. **API Gateway Integration**: No direct integration with existing API gateways
6. **Code Generation**: No automatic client SDK or code generation features
7. **Authentication Testing**: No validation of authentication mechanisms, only documentation
8. **Database Schema Documentation**: Focus is on APIs, not underlying data models

## Design Considerations

### Output Formats

1. **Markdown Documentation**: 
   - Store `api-inventory.md` in each service's root directory
   - Include service overview, endpoint list, and dependency map
   - Use consistent formatting and structure across all services

2. **OpenAPI Specifications**:
   - Generate `openapi.yaml` files for each service
   - Include complete endpoint definitions with schemas
   - Enable integration with Swagger UI and other OpenAPI tools

3. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Create a searchable, filterable interface
   - Provide service dependency visualization
   - Enable cross-service API discovery

### User Interface Requirements

- Clean, intuitive navigation between services
- Search functionality across all APIs
- Dependency graph visualization
- Export capabilities for filtered results
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Technical Considerations

1. **Codebase Analysis Engine**: Implement parsers for common frameworks (Express.js, Spring Boot, FastAPI, etc.)
2. **Context Management**: Process one service at a time to avoid overwhelming analysis context
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common API patterns and frameworks across services
4. **Data Storage**: Use structured format (JSON/YAML) for easy querying and filtering
5. **Scalability**: Design to handle ALL services in the architecture efficiently, regardless of total count
6. **Framework Support**: Support multiple programming languages and frameworks
7. **Configuration**: Allow customization of analysis rules and output formats

## Success Metrics

2. **Developer Productivity**: 60% reduction in time to discover and integrate with APIs
3. **Documentation Completeness**: 100% of endpoints have complete request/response documentation with all parameters, schemas, and examples
4. **Dependency Accuracy**: 100% of external dependencies are identified and documented
5. **User Adoption**: 80% of development teams actively use the generated documentation
6. **Incident Response**: 40% improvement in mean time to resolution for API-related issues
7. **Compliance**: 100% compliance with internal API documentation standards
8. **Onboarding Time**: 50% reduction in new developer onboarding time for API-related tasks

## Open Questions

1. **Service Prioritization**: Should we process services in any particular order (by criticality, dependencies, etc.)?
2. **Legacy Code Handling**: How should we handle services with non-standard or legacy API patterns?
3. **Private/Internal APIs**: Should we document internal/private endpoints or only public APIs?
4. **Versioning Strategy**: How should we handle services with multiple API versions?
5. **Access Control**: Who should have access to the generated documentation and in what format?
6. **Update Frequency**: How often should we plan to re-run this analysis to keep documentation current?
7. **Integration Points**: Are there existing tools or systems we should integrate with for maximum value?
8. **Resource Requirements**: What computational resources will be needed for analyzing ALL services in the architecture?
9. **Quality Assurance**: How do we ensure no APIs or services are missed during the analysis?
10. **Deep Analysis Scope**: What level of code analysis depth is required to capture all API details (surface-level vs deep code inspection)?
