# Product Requirements Document: API Usage Analysis Across All Services

## Introduction/Overview

This feature will provide comprehensive analysis of API usage patterns across all One Bangkok (OBK) services to identify performance bottlenecks, optimize dependencies, and support architectural decision-making. The system will analyze existing documentation from 33+ services to create actionable insights about API dependencies, usage frequency, and potential risks.

**Problem Statement**: With 33+ microservices in the OBK ecosystem, understanding API usage patterns, dependencies, and potential bottlenecks is crucial for system optimization, scaling decisions, and performance improvements.

**Goal**: Create an automated analysis system that processes existing service documentation to identify the most frequently used APIs, cross-service dependencies, performance risks, and provide architectural improvement recommendations.

## Goals

1. **Identify Performance Bottlenecks**: Analyze API usage patterns to identify services or endpoints that may cause performance issues
2. **Optimize API Dependencies**: Map and analyze service-to-service dependencies to reduce coupling and improve resilience
3. **Support Scaling Decisions**: Provide data-driven insights for capacity planning and infrastructure scaling
4. **Risk Assessment**: Identify high-dependency APIs that could become single points of failure
5. **Architecture Improvement**: Generate actionable recommendations for system architecture enhancements

- **As a developer**, I want to understand cross-service API usage patterns so that I can make informed decisions about new feature implementations

### Product Managers
- **As a product manager**, I want to understand resource allocation needs based on API usage patterns so that I can make informed decisions about team priorities and infrastructure investments

## Functional Requirements

### Core Analysis Engine
1. **The system must process all existing service analysis data** from the `/analysis` directory containing 33+ services
2. **The system must extract and normalize API endpoint information** from api-inventory.md files across all services
3. **The system must parse dependency maps** from dependency-map.json files to understand service relationships
4. **The system must analyze OpenAPI specifications** to understand endpoint complexity and data schemas
5. **The system must identify cross-service API calls** by matching endpoint patterns across dependency maps

### Data Processing & Analysis
6. **The system must calculate API usage frequency** across all services to identify most commonly referenced endpoints
7. **The system must identify shared dependencies** by finding APIs referenced by multiple services
8. **The system must analyze dependency depth** to identify services with complex dependency chains
9. **The system must detect potential bottlenecks** by identifying APIs with high fan-in (many services depend on them)
10. **The system must categorize APIs** by framework (Express.js, NestJS, etc.) and complexity

### Risk Assessment
11. **The system must identify high-risk dependencies** where multiple critical services depend on a single API
12. **The system must calculate dependency impact scores** based on number of dependent services and their criticality
13. **The system must flag services with no endpoints** or minimal API exposure for architecture review
14. **The system must identify circular dependencies** between services

### Reporting & Visualization
15. **The system must generate a comprehensive API usage report** listing most frequently called APIs with usage statistics
16. **The system must create dependency visualization charts** showing service relationships and API call patterns
17. **The system must produce bottleneck identification reports** highlighting performance risk areas
18. **The system must generate architectural improvement recommendations** with specific action items
19. **The system must provide exportable data** in JSON, CSV, and Markdown formats

### Multi-Format Output
20. **The system must create an interactive dashboard** for real-time exploration of API usage patterns
21. **The system must generate static reports** suitable for documentation and presentation
22. **The system must provide programmatic API access** to analysis results for integration with other tools

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Real-time API monitoring**: This analysis focuses on static documentation, not live traffic monitoring
- **Performance testing**: No load testing or runtime performance measurement
- **Code execution**: No running of services or test scripts during analysis
- **API modification**: Analysis only, no automatic API changes or optimizations
- **Authentication analysis**: Focus on structural patterns, not security implementation details
- **Database schema analysis**: Limited to API-level data schemas only
- **Historical trend analysis**: Single-point-in-time analysis based on current documentation

## Design Considerations

### Data Sources
- **Primary**: Existing analysis files in `/analysis` directory
  - `api-inventory.md` - Service API documentation
  - `dependency-map.json` - Service dependency information  
  - `openapi.yaml` - API specifications
  - `[service]-analysis.json` - Comprehensive analysis data

### User Interface Requirements
- **Dashboard**: Interactive web interface with filtering and drill-down capabilities
- **Visualizations**: Network graphs for dependencies, bar charts for usage frequency, heat maps for risk assessment
- **Export Functions**: PDF reports, CSV data exports, JSON API responses
- **Responsive Design**: Support for desktop and tablet viewing

### Performance Considerations
- **Batch Processing**: Handle analysis of 33+ services efficiently
- **Caching**: Cache analysis results to avoid reprocessing unchanged data
- **Incremental Updates**: Support adding new services without full reanalysis

## Technical Considerations

### Technology Requirements
- **Analysis Engine**: Node.js/Python for data processing and analysis
- **Data Storage**: JSON/CSV files for results, possibly SQLite for complex queries
- **Visualization**: D3.js or similar for interactive charts and dependency graphs
- **Web Framework**: Express.js or similar for dashboard API
- **Frontend**: React/Vue.js for interactive dashboard

### Integration Points
- **File System**: Read analysis data from `/analysis` directory structure
- **Export Systems**: Generate outputs compatible with existing documentation tools
- **Version Control**: Track analysis results and changes over time

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Discovery**: Scan `/analysis` directory for service data
2. **Parsing**: Extract API and dependency information from each service
3. **Normalization**: Standardize data formats across different service types
4. **Analysis**: Calculate usage patterns, dependencies, and risk scores
5. **Reporting**: Generate visualizations and export results

## Open Questions

1. **Service Criticality Weighting**: How should we weight different services (core vs. auxiliary) in dependency risk calculations?
2. **Update Frequency**: How often should the analysis be re-run as services evolve?
3. **Historical Comparison**: Should we track changes in API usage patterns over time?
4. **External API Integration**: Should we include analysis of external third-party API dependencies in future iterations?
5. **Performance Baseline**: What performance thresholds should trigger bottleneck alerts?
6. **Notification System**: Should the system alert teams when their services become high-dependency risks?
7. **Custom Metrics**: What service-specific metrics should be configurable by different teams?
