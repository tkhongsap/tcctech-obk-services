### Notes

- **CRITICAL**: Process exactly ONE folder at a time - never skip or batch process multiple folders
- Each folder analysis must be 100% complete before moving to the next folder
- **MANDATORY**: Git commit and push to remote repository after each folder is completed
- Generated documentation should follow consistent formatting across all folders
- Use structured JSON/YAML for data interchange between analysis components
- Maintain strict folder processing checklist to ensure all 37+ folders are covered
- Each folder should have its own api-inventory.md, openapi.yaml, and dependency-map.json files
- Progress tracking is essential: always know which folder is currently being processed and how many remain
- **READ-ONLY OPERATION**: No code execution, no testing, no service startup - only file reading and analysis
- All scripts are simple file readers and parsers - no complex execution required

### Processing Protocol (Per @process-api-tasks.mdc Rule)

**For Each Service Processing:**
1. **Run Analysis**: `node scripts/api-analyzer.js [service-name]`
2. **Generate Documentation**: `node scripts/output-generator.js output/[service-name]-analysis.json [service-name]`
3. **Immediate Commit**: `git add . && git commit -m "docs: API analysis for [service-name]" && git push`
4. **Update Task List**: Mark service as `[x]` with metrics
5. **Update Progress Counter**: Increment completion count (e.g., 2/37 COMPLETED)
6. **Continue Automatically**: Move to next service without user approval

**Error Handling Protocol:**
- **Stop processing** if any service analysis fails
- **Report specific errors** and suggested fixes
- **Resume processing** from the failed service after fixes
- **Never skip services** - all 37 must be completed

**Quality Validation Per Service:**
- Verify all endpoints discovered and documented
- Confirm schemas and dependencies extracted
- Validate generated files exist (api-inventory.md, openapi.yaml, dependency-map.json)
- Ensure git commit successful before proceeding

### 5.1 Service Processing Workflow (Per @process-api-tasks.mdc Rule)

**Processing Commands for Each Service:**
```bash
# For each service in the checklist below:
node scripts/api-analyzer.js [service-name]
node scripts/output-generator.js output/[service-name]-analysis.json [service-name]
git add . && git commit -m "docs: API analysis for [service-name]" && git push
# Update task list: Mark service as [x] with endpoint/schema/dependency counts
# Update progress counter (e.g., 2/37 COMPLETED)
# Continue automatically to next service
```

**Automation Rules:**
- ‚úÖ **No user approval required** between services once processing starts
- ‚úÖ **Automatic progression** through the service list in order listed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Stop only on errors** - report issues and wait for fixes
- ‚úÖ **Quality validation** after each service completion
