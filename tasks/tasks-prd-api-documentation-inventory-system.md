### Notes

- **CRITICAL**: Process exactly ONE folder at a time - never skip or batch process multiple folders
- Each folder analysis must be 100% complete before moving to the next folder
- **MANDATORY**: Git commit and push to remote repository after each folder is completed
- Generated documentation should follow consistent formatting across all folders
- Use structured JSON/YAML for data interchange between analysis components
- Maintain strict folder processing checklist to ensure all 37+ folders are covered
- Each folder should have its own api-inventory.md, openapi.yaml, and dependency-map.json files
- Progress tracking is essential: always know which folder is currently being processed and how many remain
