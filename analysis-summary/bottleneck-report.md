## Potential Bottleneck Services

### High-Endpoint Services (50+ endpoints)


#### tcct-serviceabstraction-dev
- **Framework**: .NET
- **Endpoints**: 352
- **Language**: C#
- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Recommendation**: Implement API gateway and rate limiting
\n
#### obk-operation-backend-dev
- **Framework**: .NET
- **Endpoints**: 306
- **Language**: C#
- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Recommendation**: Implement API gateway and rate limiting


## Framework Analysis

### .NET Services
- Contain the majority of system endpoints
- Should be prioritized for performance monitoring
- Consider microservice decomposition if services become too large

### Node.js/Express Services  
- Lower endpoint density suggests potential for API discovery improvements
- May benefit from OpenAPI/Swagger documentation standardization

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Implement monitoring for services with 100+ endpoints
   - Set up performance baselines for high-endpoint .NET services
   
2. **Medium-term**:
   - Consider API gateway implementation for top 5 services
   - Implement rate limiting on critical endpoints
   
3. **Long-term**:
   - Evaluate service decomposition for services with 200+ endpoints
   - Standardize API documentation across all frameworks
