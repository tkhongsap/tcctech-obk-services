|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| tcct-serviceabstraction-dev | .NET | 352 | C# |\n| obk-operation-backend-dev | .NET | 306 | C# |\n| obk-wiremock-trunk | Express.js | 15 | JavaScript/TypeScript |\n| azure-ocr-trunk | FastAPI | 7 | Python |\n| resize-service-trunk | Next.js | 6 | JavaScript/TypeScript |\n| obk-cms-trunk | unknown | 3 | unknown |\n| obk-indoor-navigation-trunk | Node.js | 1 | JavaScript/TypeScript |\n| obk-mtel-bms-trunk | Express.js | 1 | JavaScript/TypeScript |\n| obk-mtel-bus-trunk | Express.js | 1 | JavaScript/TypeScript |\n| obk-mtel-document-trunk | Express.js | 1 | JavaScript/TypeScript |

## API Endpoint Summary

### Services with Most Endpoints:
- **tcct-serviceabstraction-dev**: 352 endpoints (.NET)\n- **obk-operation-backend-dev**: 306 endpoints (.NET)\n- **obk-wiremock-trunk**: 15 endpoints (Express.js)\n- **azure-ocr-trunk**: 7 endpoints (FastAPI)\n- **resize-service-trunk**: 6 endpoints (Next.js)

### Framework Analysis:
- **.NET services** have the highest endpoint density with 658 total endpoints
- **Express.js/Node.js services** provide 19 endpoints across 8 services
- **FastAPI/Python services** contribute 7 endpoints

## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks Identified

- **Circular Dependencies**: 0 detected
- **High Dependency Services**: 0 flagged
- **Unused Services**: 0 identified

### Service Distribution Analysis

- **High-API Services**: 2 services with 50+ endpoints
- **Medium-API Services**: 1 services with 10-50 endpoints  
- **Low-API Services**: 7 services with 1-9 endpoints
- **No-API Services**: 27 services with no detected endpoints

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis of 697 API endpoints across 37 services:

### 1. Focus on High-Endpoint Services
- **tcct-serviceabstraction-dev** and **obk-operation-backend-dev** contain the majority of endpoints
- These .NET services should be prioritized for performance optimization and monitoring
- Consider API gateway patterns for these high-traffic services

### 2. Framework Standardization
- .NET services show the highest API density and comprehensive documentation
- Consider standardizing API documentation practices across all frameworks
- Node.js/Express services may need improved API discovery and documentation

### 3. Service Architecture
- 27 services show no endpoints, likely indicating:
  - Frontend applications without backend APIs
  - Worker services or scheduled jobs
  - Services requiring improved API discovery
  
### 4. API Gateway Implementation
- With 697 total endpoints, consider implementing API gateway patterns
- Focus gateway implementation on the top 10 highest-endpoint services
- Implement rate limiting and monitoring for critical .NET services

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Analysis Methodology
- Analysis based on comprehensive service-specific JSON analysis files
- Endpoints extracted from static code analysis, not runtime discovery
- Framework detection based on project structure and dependencies
- Total analysis coverage: 37/37 services (100%)

### Data Sources
- Primary: `[service-name]-analysis.json` files containing detailed endpoint data
- Secondary: `api-inventory.md` files for metadata and framework information
- Tertiary: `dependency-map.json` files for service relationships

## Conclusion

This analysis reveals a highly diverse microservices ecosystem with 697 API endpoints distributed across 10 different technology stacks. The .NET services (tcct-serviceabstraction-dev and obk-operation-backend-dev) contain the vast majority of documented endpoints, suggesting they serve as primary service abstraction layers.

The analysis provides a foundation for making informed decisions about API optimization, infrastructure scaling, and service architecture improvements. Regular monitoring of the high-endpoint .NET services should be prioritized.
